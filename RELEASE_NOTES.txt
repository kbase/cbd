OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
Compression-based distance (CBD) is a simple, rapid, and accurate method to
efficiently assess differences in microbiota samples [1].  CBD characterizes
the similarities between microbial communities via the amount of repetition
or overlap in order to determine microbial community distance.  CBD relies on
the fact that more repetitive data is, the more it can be compressed.  By
combining 16S rRNA hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing
the relative amounts of compression, there is a proxy for the similarities
between the communities.  The amount of compression is converted to a distance
by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total
compressed size of the individual datasets.  The distance has a value with a
minimum of 0 meaning the communities are the same and a maximum of 1 meaning
the communities are completely different.

VERSION: 1.4.0 (Released 03/10/2014)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-None.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-Updated cbd-buildmatrix and cbd-buildmatrixlocal to automatically determine
 file format from file extension.
-Added --trim option to cbd-buildmatrix and cbd-buildmatrixlocal to trim
 sequences to a common length.
-Added --min-reads and --max-reads options to cbd-buildmatrix and
 cbd-buildmatrixlocal.  Use --min-reads to make sure a sequence file has a
 minimum number of sequence reads.  Use --max-reads to limit the number of
 sequence reads used from a sequence file.  The algorithm does not work when
 the sequence files have significantly different numbers of sequence reads.
-Added --extreme option to cbd-buildmatrix and cbd-buildmatrixlocal to use
 extreme compression which is slower but can have a higher compression ratio.
-Improved error reporting and added --show-error option to cbd-buildmatrix
 and cbd-buildmatrixlocal commands.
-Added --url option to cbd-buildmatrix, removed cbd-url from IRIS environment,
 and changed cbd-url to use standard KBase config file.
-Added --show-times option to cbd-getmatrix to show start and finish times
 for successful jobs.
-Added two new plots to cbd-plotmatrix for generating dendrogram and metric
 dimensional scaling plots along with additional options for controlling the
 format of the plots.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-None.

VERSION: 1.3.0 (Released 01/06/2014)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-Added cbd-buildmatrixlocal command script to build distance matrix on local
 system (without transferring files through Shock).

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-Removed debug configuration variable and improved error reporting.
-Fixed bug where file names with embedded periods caused a ValueError exception.
-Fixed bug stripping suffix from path names when calculating distance matrix.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-Add more output options for cbd-plotmatrix.

VERSION: 1.2.0 (Released 11/18/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-Added cbd-plotmatrix command script to generate figures and plots from a
 distance matrix.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-Switched to user and job state service for job management.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-Add more output options for cbd-plotmatrix.

VERSION: 1.1.0 (Released 10/28/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-Added cbd-filtermatrix command script to filter matrix by groups.
-Added group list field to file with list of input sequence files.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-Fixed using cbd-url from an IRIS terminal.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-Ability to generate figures and plots from distance matrix.

VERSION: 1.0.0 (Released 09/04/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first public release of the Compression Based Distance service.
-Added method and command scripts to build a distance matrix.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-None.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-Ability to assign samples to a group and compare groups.
