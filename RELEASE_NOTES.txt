OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
Compression-based distance (CBD) is a simple, rapid, and accurate method to
efficiently assess differences in microbiota samples [1].  CBD characterizes
the similarities between microbial communities via the amount of repetition
or overlap in order to determine microbial community distance.  CBD relies on
the fact that more repetitive data is the more it can be compressed.  By
combining 16S rRNA hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing
the relative amounts of compression, there is a proxy for the similarities
between the communities.  The amount of compression is converted to a distance
by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total
compressed size of the individual datasets.  The distance has a value with a
minimum of 0 meaning the communities are the same and a maximum of 1 meaning
the communities are completely different.
